                    makes me feel that seconds are extended like days,<br>
                    Always making me feel to see it nowadays,<br>
                    since i doubt after seeing such an attractive face,<br>

                    i just ont the spot got froze,<br>
                    with a strong urge , i instantly liked to propose,<br>
                    but i knew that for this i need to come close (to your heart),<br>
                    for my feelings to get expose,<br>
                    and i can give you a rose,<br>
                    but alas this stupid corona,<br>
                    took every moment,<br>
                    leaving me saying "Tu beta ab khali rona",<br>
                    because you wont get your babu shona,<br>
